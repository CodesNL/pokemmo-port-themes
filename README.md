Pok√©MMO Custom Themes (Portmaster Edition)

Welcome to the official repository for custom Pok√©MMO themes, specifically built for the Pok√©MMO port running via Portmaster.

Whether you want to personalize your in-game UI or create your own custom login animation, this repo provides ready-to-use assets and a foundation to build upon.
üìÅ Installation Guide

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This setup currently supports custom login screen animations only. Full theme support is in development.

1. Install Pok√©MMO via GitHub

Follow the instructions on the official Pok√©MMO port to install the game.
2. Clone or Download This Repository

3. Copy Theme Files

    Copy the Default theme folder to:
    ~/ports/pokemmo/data/themes

4. Apply the Login Animation Files

    From the Default folder, copy these files:

        anim/

        login-animation.xml

        theme.xml

    To:
    ~/ports/pokemmo/data/mods/console_mod/console

üé® Creating Your Own Login Animation

Follow these steps to create a custom login animation using your own video or GIF.
1. Convert Video to Frames

    Go to ezgif.com

    Upload your video or GIF.

    Convert it to PNG frames.

    Download the result as a .zip file.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
    Use ezgif.com specifically, as the XML animation relies on its naming format.
    Using another tool may require renaming files or editing the XML manually.

2. Ensure Correct Resolution

    The animation should match your device's resolution.
    For the RG35XXSP, use 640x480.

3. Add Frames to Your Theme

    Extract the PNG frames into the anim/ folder inside your theme (both in data/themes and mods/console_mod/console).

    Update both theme.xml and login-animation.xml to reflect your image count.

4. Add This Line to Both theme.xml Files

Make sure this line is included in both copies of theme.xml:

XML Theme Line
5. Update login-animation.xml

For example, if you have 145 images, add this to the XML:

<images file="anim/ezgif-frame-145.png" filter="nearest">
  <area name="bg-f00145" xywh="*"/>
</images>

XML Image Example

Also, update the frame duration section accordingly:

<frame ref="bg-f00145" duration="50"/>

üß™ Custom Theme Support (WIP)

Full UI theming is currently experimental.

You can try placing your custom Theme folder in both:

    ~/ports/pokemmo/data/themes

    ~/ports/pokemmo/data/mods/console_mod/console

This may allow some customization, but full support is not guaranteed yet. Stay tuned for future updates.
